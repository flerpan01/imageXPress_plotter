>short summary

>Code was used in this paper: [Mitochondrial health assay in D.Magna using JC-1 fluorescence dye](https://doi.org/)

## Project structure

Two example files are found in `imgxpress_files` folder to test the code on. `bin` contains the functions and code needed to produce the plots.

```sh
project
|-- bin
|   `-- R
|       |-- functions.R
|       `-- script.R
|-- data
|   
|-- img

|-- imgxpress_files

`-- readme.md
```


## Code explanation

The imageXPress output files comes as excel and should contain 4 tabs: (1) "red", (2) "green", (3) "Segmentation" and (4) "Samples".
Tabs 1-3 are autogenerated by the imageXpress machine, tab 4 is manual (written during loading of the machine) and contains info about sample concentrations.

+ red = red channel
+ green = green channel
+ Segmentation = masking layer
+ Samples = sample metadata w/ concentrations

The `scripts.R` loads any files found in `imgxpress_files/` and produces for each file a figure with three plots (A) sample averages plotted against concentrations, (B) ratio between red / green channel (averages), and (C) distribution plots of each concentrations (`img/file.pdf`). Additionally, a csv with values for plot B is produced (`data/file.csv`).
